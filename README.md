Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

All data from the meta-analysis are in the folder: data

# Code
Matlab scripts a,b,c create the reference connectome (access to 10k1day data required), perform the rich club analyses, and visualize the results. The scripts require the Brain Connectivity Toolbox for Matlab.
The folder meta contains python code (markdown and notebook) to perform the meta-analysis.
Matlab scripts d,e process the results (as reported in the paper)
Matlab script f plots rich club regions (Enigma toolbox required)
Matlab script g reproduces Figure 2 from the paper.
The summary data are in data (aggregated subject level data points as presented in the paper, without any identifier).

# Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant cerebral dysfunction, including increased amyloid deposition, gray matter atrophy, and changes in brain function. The involvement of highly connected network hubs, known as the "rich club," in the pathology of the disease remains inconclusive despite previous research efforts. In this study, we aimed to systematically assess the link between the rich club and AD using a multimodal neuroimaging approach.
We employed network analyses of diffusion MRI, longitudinal assessments of gray matter atrophy, amyloid deposition measurements using PET imaging, and meta-analytic data on functional activation differences. Our study focused on evaluating the role of both the core and extended rich club regions in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and those diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.
Our findings revealed that rich club regions exhibited accelerated gray matter atrophy and increased amyloid deposition in both MCI and Alzheimer's Disease. Importantly, these regions remained unaffected by altered functional activation patterns observed outside the core rich club regions. These results shed light on the connection between two major AD biomarkers and the rich club, providing valuable insights into AD as a potential disconnection syndrome.
